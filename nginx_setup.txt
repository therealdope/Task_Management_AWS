Here are the step-by-step commands to set up Nginx on your EC2 instance:

1. Install Nginx:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

2. Create/edit the Nginx configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

3. Replace the content with this configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

4. Test Nginx configuration:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

5. Restart Nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

6. Enable Nginx to start on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

7. Check Nginx status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

Don't forget to:
1. Update EC2 security group to allow inbound traffic on port 80
2. Make sure your Node.js app is running on port 3000

Now you can access your application using just:
```
http://your-ec2-public-ip
```
