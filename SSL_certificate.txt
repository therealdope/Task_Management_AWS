To set up SSL certificate for your EC2 instance using Let's Encrypt and Certbot, follow these steps:
taskmanage.duckdns.org

1. First, install Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

2. You'll need a domain name pointing to your EC2 instance. Update your Nginx configuration with your domain:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Update the configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

3. Obtain SSL certificate:
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com -d www.your-domain.com
```

4. Follow the prompts from Certbot

5. Verify auto-renewal is set up:
```bash
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

Don't forget to:
1. Add domain DNS A record pointing to your EC2 IP
2. Update EC2 security group to allow HTTPS (port 443)
